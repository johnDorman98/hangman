## Welcome to my hangman game! üëã 
This is the first of a few mini-games I am planning to make using Python. Each one will be more complex and fun than the previous one. It is used as a way to demostrade my knowledge and test myself at creating projects that I would have fun using.

<a name="features"></a>
## Features 
* It displays a logo and a visual representation of the users' remaining lives.
* It lets the user guess a letter.
* It checks if the user's letter is within the word and if it is, it fills in the blank.
* Blanks are generated for each letter in the full word.
* If the user guesses each letter correctly, they win the game.
* If the user loses all of their lives, they lose the game.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation 
* In order for this program to work, you will need two main things. The first is Python installed on your computer, and the second is an IDE to run the program.
* Below is a link that will take you through the setup and installation for Python.
  
    [Python installation link](https://medium.com/co-learning-lounge/how-to-download-install-python-on-windows-2021-44a707994013)

* Now that you have confirmed that Python is installed and working, we can download the program and run it. In order to download the zip file for the program, you can click on the download button below.

    [Download Project](https://github.com/johnDorman98/caesar-cipher/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

* In this case, you can choose to extract it where you wish to. Once it has been extracted, open the zipped folder and you will see a folder inside of it. Extract this folder.

## Usage  
* Because this project is more involved, we will be installing an IDE to run the program and also to download our imports. We will run the code from this IDE and the one we will use for this example is VSCode. However, you are welcome to use any IDE that works with Python.
* I will share a link to a guide by Visual Studio Code on how to install VSCode.
    
    [Link for VSCode installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)

* The next step is to get VSCode setup for Python, so below is a guide also by Visual Studio Code on how to get it setup.

    [Link for Python setup with VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

* Once you have VSCode installed and setup, we can move onto the next steps on how to get the program running.
  * You should be greeted with a screen similar to the one below.

  * Click on open folder and navigate to the new folder you extracted, which should only have the extracted files within.
  * Right-click the file 'main.py' and select 'Run Python file in Terminal'. The terminal will then prompt you for inputs.
